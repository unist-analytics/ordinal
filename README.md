In this repository, there are are codes for classifying the imbalanced and ordinal data.

This repository includes, 

1) data for test
2) function for classfying
3) main for showing the result by the graph

implementation

Before running the main program, you should make two files, which called "source" and "input", and 
install the data into "input" file and function,"kknn.ordinal.R", into "source".
You must save files like this way to run main R program correctly. 
If you run "akknn_type.R", you cann see the graph for compairng the knn method, wknn and awknn.

To use this r program, we suggest you use the "cmd batch", which help you run R program without R or R studio.
To do this, first you have to set up path sutaible for R.
